Important things to put in the report.
1. Justify selection of algortihms
2. Correctness proofs on code
3. Complexity analysis of overall algorithm
4. Justify efficiency tradeoffs in light of performance
5. Document all iterations and why that path was chosen
6. Appendices must include
  i. Testing/Correctness/Verification (1 section)
  ii. Runtime Complexity and Walltime (1 section)
  iii. Performance (according to the aforementioned criterion)
  iv. ustification for the algorithm selected in your final implementation out of the set of implementations you tested
7. explore the problem and solution space, and report any ideas, interesting insights, and rationale you uncover for tackling the problem
8. Any useful figures, plots, tables, or analyses are allowed to illustrate your level of depth at which you thought about the problem and your solutions.
9. Make sure all code is well-commented

FGSM algorithm
Justification - The Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) is a method for generating adversial attacks that is simple yet effective.  "FGSM is a single step
attack, ie.. the perturbation is added in a single step instead of adding it over a loop (Iterative attack). (INSERT CITATION)".
